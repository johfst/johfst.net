<p>This blog is generated with a few template files, a bit of css, and a roughly 50-line
python script. All-in-all, it took maybe three late-night hours to get everything 
working; I'm writing this at 4:09 AM on Friday morning.</p>
<p>I've heard a lot recently about how <a href="https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/">everyone should have a blog</a>, for
various reasons, but the one that sticks out to me the most is that writing
helps you think better. I remember realizing, in my first freshman year calculus
class, the first time I encountered real mathematical thinking, that being able
to think clearly is a very important skill. To find the solution to a math
problem, computational or fundamental, you need to understand exactly what you're 
talking about. This seems broadly true of ideas in general.</p>
<p>So I guess I'll put stuff here that I'm thinking about in the hopes that I'll
better understand it myself. Maybe someone else will find it useful too.</p>
<p>And now I realize I've just copied xkcd -_-</p>
